description: Prefer shadcn and React Aria for all UI work
alwaysApply: true
---

Use this component policy for the whole project:

- Always build UI with shadcn or react-aria-components components and Tailwind CSS.
- For accessibility and behavior primitives, use React Aria hooks/components.
- Use React 19 conventions for refs: do not use `forwardRef` in new components.
- Export components with `export function ComponentName(...)` instead of `export const`.
- Reuse components from `@repo/ui` first before creating new ones.
- Do not introduce Material UI (`@mui/*`), Chakra UI, Ant Design, or other UI frameworks.
- If a required component does not exist yet, create it in shared UI using Tailwind + React Aria patterns.

When updating existing code:

- Replace legacy non-compliant UI components with shadcn/Tailwind + React Aria equivalents.
- Refactor components that use `forwardRef` to React 19 ref patterns when touched.
