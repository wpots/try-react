# User Story 007.1: Implement Diary Entry Form - Part 1 (Basic Structure and Text Fields)

## 1. Title

Implement the basic structure of the diary entry form and text-based input fields using React MUI components.

## 2. Goal

To create the foundational structure for the diary entry form and implement the text-based input fields ('Food Eaten', 'Description', 'Date', 'Time') using React MUI components.

## 3. Description

As a junior developer, I need to start building the diary entry form by setting up the basic component structure and implementing the simpler text-based input fields. This is the first part of creating the complete diary entry form.

## 4. Technical Details

- **React Component:** Create `EntryForm.tsx` in `src/components/`.
- **MUI Components:** Use MUI `TextField` for 'Food Eaten', 'Description', 'Date' (type="date"), and 'Time' (initially type="text").
- **Basic Form Structure:** Set up a basic form structure using `<Box component="form">` and handle form submission (initially just `console.log`).
- **State Management:** Use `useState` for 'foodEaten', 'description', 'date', and 'time' fields.

## 5. Steps to Implement

1. **Create `EntryForm` Component File:**
   - Create a new file `src/components/EntryForm.tsx`.
2. **Import Necessary MUI and React Modules:**
   - Import `React`, `useState` from 'react'.
   - Import `Box`, `TextField` from '@mui/material'.
3. **Define `EntryForm` Functional Component:**
   - Define a functional component `EntryForm`.
4. **Implement State Variables:**
   - Use `useState` to create state variables for `foodEaten`, `description`, `date`, and `time`, initializing them as empty strings.
5. **Implement Basic Form Structure and Text Fields:**
   - In the `EntryForm` component's `return` statement:
     - Use `<Box component="form" onSubmit={handleSubmit} noValidate sx={{ mt: 1 }}>` to create the form.
     - Implement `TextField` components for 'Food Eaten', 'Description', 'Date' (with `type="date"`), and 'Time' (initially with `type="text"`).
     - Connect each `TextField` to its corresponding state variable using `value` and `onChange` props.
     - Implement a basic `handleSubmit` function that for now just logs the values of `foodEaten` and `description` to the console when the form is submitted.
6. **Render `EntryForm` in `CreateEntryPage`:**
   - Open `src/app/entry/create/page.tsx` and ensure `EntryForm` component is imported and rendered.
7. **Verify in Browser:**
   - Run `npm run dev` and navigate to `/entry/create`.
   - You should see the form with 'Food Eaten', 'Description', 'Date', and 'Time' text fields.
   - Enter values and submit the form. Check the browser console to see the logged data.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- `EntryForm.tsx` component is created in `src/components/`.
- Basic form structure with MUI `Box` and `form` is implemented.
- MUI `TextField` components are used for 'Food Eaten', 'Description', 'Date', and 'Time' fields.
- State management using `useState` is implemented for these fields.
- Basic `handleSubmit` function logs form data to console.
- Form is rendered in `CreateEntryPage` and text fields are visible and functional in the browser.

## 7. Notes

- This is the first part of implementing the diary entry form. The next part will add the more complex fields (selects, chips) and enhance form submission.
- Styling and layout can be further refined in later user stories.
